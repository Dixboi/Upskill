How would you analyze this dataset to identify trends, patterns, or insights that could help optimize our sales strategy?** 

**My Answer:** Step 1: I would approach a superior or someone who has domain knowledge or someone who is directly involved in sales so that I can ask questions about the sales data from past year. The following are some of the questions that I would like to ask: a) Are there scenarios such as "discounts", "limited time sales", or "spontaneous movements like Violence Against Women"? b) Are the components sold online or in shop? The answers from this questions can help me provide a better analysis.

Step 2: I will perform a data quality check where I will check if there are any missing values, incorrect inputs, and duplicates. I will deal with those issues accordingly. For the missing values, I will ask a superior or someone who has domain knowledge or someone who is directly involved in sales if it is okay that the values are missing or there should be an action needed to deal with it. 

Step 3: I will process the data by adding more features. The features will be "year", "month", and "day". This can help me provide insights like "the month of July has the lowest number of sales due to vacation" and "Friday has the most number of sales because it is the last weekday of the week", but that will be done on step 4.

Step 4: I will use a data visualization tool to start my analysis. I will use a line graph to visualize the the trend of sales with respect to dates, I will use a bar chart to see which of the electronic components are sold the most, and many more.

**ChatGPT Review:** Thank you for your response. Here's my evaluation and feedback:

Seeking domain knowledge: It's great that you would reach out to a superior or someone with domain knowledge to gain a better understanding of the sales data. Asking questions about scenarios like discounts, limited-time sales, or sales channels (online vs. in-store) is a good approach. This will help you contextualize the data and consider relevant factors that could impact the analysis.

Data quality check: Performing a data quality check is an important step. Checking for missing values, incorrect inputs, and duplicates is a good practice. However, it would be beneficial to develop a systematic approach to handle these issues. For missing values, you mentioned consulting a superior or someone with domain knowledge, which is appropriate. Additionally, consider exploring techniques like imputation (if applicable) or assessing the impact of missing values on your analysis.

Feature engineering: Creating additional features like "year," "month," and "day" is a valuable step to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. This will allow you to analyze sales trends over time and identify patterns related to specific months or days of the week. Make sure to validate the necessity of these features by considering their potential impact on the analysis and alignment with the objectives.

Data visualization: Utilizing data visualization tools to analyze the dataset is a commendable approach. Line graphs to visualize sales trends over time and bar charts to identify the most sold components are suitable choices. However, don't limit yourself to these basic visualizations. Consider exploring other types of visualizations like heatmaps, scatter plots, or stacked area charts to uncover additional insights or relationships within the data.

Overall, your approach demonstrates a good understanding of the initial steps involved in analyzing the sales dataset. To improve further, consider developing a more structured plan for handling missing values and addressing data quality issues. Additionally, explore a wider range of visualization techniques to fully exploit the dataset's potential for optimizing the sales strategy.

**Question 3: As a data analyst, you have been given a dataset containing customer feedback data for our electronic components. The dataset includes customer ratings, reviews, and additional metadata such as the product purchased, date of purchase, and customer demographics. How would you analyze this dataset to extract insights that can help improve our product offerings and customer satisfaction?**

**My Answer:** Step 1: First, I will perform a data quality check to see if there are inconsistencies in the data such as missing values and duplicates, and I will deal with it accordingly. 

Step 2: I will add another feature on the dataset which is "sentiments" where it contains values about the sentiments of the feedback.

Step 3: I will use a data analysis tool such as Python or MS Power BI to visualize and find patterns in data. The analysis will contain which product has the most reviews, which product has the highest rating to review ratio, which product contains the most positive reviews, which product contains the most negative reviews.

Step 4: I will show the analysis that I performed from step 3 to my superiors and to people who are directly involved in customer satisfaction. By doing this step, I can know if I should add more analysis, if there are problems that I didn't answer, and any other feedback that they can provide.
